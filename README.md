Store front mock-up that uses a real API and designs. Done in jetpack compose.

Definitely prioritized getting in the functionality first before trying to match the UI to the design here (https://www.figma.com/design/Okwf4nk3Llza64um00LHrH/Souvenir---Website-Test-Project-1?node-id=2135-990&node-type=frame&t=y9pYZ2y8I0SBDfCD-0). Also all strings and dimens, colours, etc are inline which I hate to do but within the timeframe the functionality was the top priority. Definitely could use some refactoring.
